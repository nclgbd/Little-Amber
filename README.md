## Usage
If (~~for some inexplicable reason~~) you'd like fork this bot and use it for yourself, great! Just know...
* You'll have to make a folder name `config` and inside that folder create a json file named `config.json`.
* In there, it should look something like this:
```javascript
{
    "token": "TOKEN_STRING",
    "prefix": "PREFIX",
    "client_id": BOT_ID,
    "me": PROGRAMMER_ID
}
```

And you're good to go!
